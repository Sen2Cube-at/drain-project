In the DRAIN project, different technologies are being further developed and integrated to improve the prediction of soil erosion.

An important source of information is up-to-date land surface data, which are analyzed based on the European Sentinel-2 satellites from the Copernicus Programme. This image shows a Sentinel-2 satellite acquisition from August 2025. It depicts a large-scale landscape with green meadows and forests.

In contrast, an image from October 2025 shows a different picture: many agricultural fields have been harvested and display exposed soil.

In spring or autumn, these fields are more vulnerable, with heavy rainfall events tending to occur more frequently in spring. In the DRAIN project, these satellite data are analyzed, meteorological forecasting models are improved, enhanced methods for calculating erosion are developed, and, together with farmers, a technical solution for analysis and visualization is being created.
